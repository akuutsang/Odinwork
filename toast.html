        <ol>
            <li>White Bread</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Vanilla and Cinnamon</li>

        </ol>
           <p>Every home cook has their own twist on basic French toast, but most variations contain the following ingredients:

           <p> White Bread;
            Thick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better than thin, airy ones.</p> 
            <p>Eggs;
            When it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.</p>
           <p> Milk;
            You can technically use any liquid to make French toast, though milk is most popular. Not only does milk add the necessary moisture, but the fat gives the batter extra richness. This recipe calls for whole milk because it creates the ideal texture. You can easily substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk – full-fat varieties will produce the creamiest consistency.</p> 
            
            <p>Vanilla and Cinnamon;
            The best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it.</p>
            
           <p> Salt;
            Don't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor. Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, and prevents egg chunks in the finished product.</p>
            
            <p>Butter;
            Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil.

        <h3>How to Make French Toast</h3>
        <p>It's easier than you think to make restaurant-quality French toast in the comfort of your own kitchen – you just need a skillet, a few staple ingredients, and a good recipe. That's where we come in!</p>
        <h4>Best Bread For French Toast</h4>
        <p>The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do. 
             French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste – it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.
